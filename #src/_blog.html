        <h2>Title H2</h2>
        <p>
            Time Anomalies, otherwise known as temporal distortions or time slips, have long been an interest of mine.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first time I remember taking a definite interest was when I was writing a book called The Ghostly Guide
            to the Lake District. As well as collecting local folklore and well-known legends, I wanted to bring the
            material up to date and demonstrate that people continued to have paranormal experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wrote the book in 1998, and I put a notice in the local newspaper asking people to get in touch. A woman
            called Angela Charlton got in touch. At the time, I was living in a town called Penrith, Cumbria, England,
            and this story happened to Angela in Penrith. Stranger still, at the time she had the time slip experience
            she lived in the same house I was living in when I wrote the book.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Penrith, Cumbria
        </h2>
        <p>
            Angela reported a strange experience as she walked on a steep path between pine trees up to the top of
            Beacon Hill that overlooks Penrith. At the time, she was a teenager. Angela would often climb the Beacon
            when she wasn’t at school, and it’s still a popular local walk.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                One hot day in August in the mid-1970s, Angela and a friend set out onto the footpath from Beacon Edge.
                The walk takes about fifteen minutes, and the path has many abrupt angles as it zig-zags through the
                trees. The trees crowd thickly round the track as it climbs over craggy sandstone outcrops. Soon you
                feel quite apart from the everyday world. It’s an odd feeling, and you can have the impression that
                someone is watching you from the woods on either side. You go up and up, changing direction and losing
                sight of the path below and behind you.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            As Angela and her friend climbed that day they chatted away, but Angela reports how the atmosphere grew
            increasingly heavy — as if there was thunder in the air. They’d walked up many times and weren’t taking much
            notice of their surroundings until they turned a corner and stopped. They both saw it: an old fashioned
            cottage, roughly made of stone.
        </p>

        <p>
            When she worked up the courage to climb the hill some months later, the cottage wasn’t there. Her friend
            would never talk about the experience.
